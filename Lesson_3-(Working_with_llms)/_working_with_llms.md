# Working with LLMS:

As we have studied earlier advanced natural language processing activities like text generation, question answering, and reasoning are made possible by LLMs in LangChain. They operate as the central engine for creating intelligent programs that can comprehend, produce, and communicate in complex workflows with human language.

## Paid vs Open-source
There are several options when we talk about llms. Now, almost all the big giants of tech industry have developed there own llms which are trained on very large amounts of data. These llms include both paid llms like GPT and opensource llms like Llama, Gemma etc. These open-source llms are free to use but you have to download them into your machine.

I will use GPT in this course but as many people cannot afford paid llms, so I will tell a way to work with open-source llm as well. From here, I have made separate files so make sure to read accordingly.
