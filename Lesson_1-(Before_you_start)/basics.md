# Understanding the Basics:

Here is what you need to know before you start learning Langchain.

## Prerequisites:
Before you start learning Langchain, you must know the following:
* Python Programming
* Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs)

So you think you know all of the above mentioned technologies, now let's understand what is Langchain and why do we need it.

## What is Langchain?
LangChain is a language model integration framework designed to simplify the process of developing applications using generative models (mainly large language models e.g. GPT). It is utilized in tasks like document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. The power of generative models is enhanced when used with LangChain.

## Why Langchain:
Since there are some other tools out there like LlamaIndex, we first need to know why Langchain and how it is better.

Langchain is a powerful tool that can manage prompts, context, or integrate multiple data sources offering a streamlined interface that simplifies the development of applications using LLMs. This enables developers to focus on the application's logic rather than the intricacies of model interaction. Here are some awesome benifits offered by Langchain:

* Simplicity
* Scalability
* Supports Complex Workflows and Reasoning
* Integration with External Data Sources
* Enhanced Prompt Engineering Tools
* Memory and State Management
* Supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Community and Ecosystem
